Content for this microarray was generated from leading public databases, including RefSeq, RIKEN, NIA, Ensembl, RIKEN, UCSC Goldenpath, and Unigene.. . Arrays of this design have barcodes that begin with 16012694 or 2512694.. . Orientation:. Features are numbered numbered Left-to-Right, Top-to-Bottom as scanned by an Agilent scanner (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass), matching the FeatureNum output from Agilent's Feature Extraction software.. . The ID column represents the Agilent Feature Extraction feature number.. . Rows and columns are numbered as scanned by an Axon Scanner (barcode on the bottom, DNA on the front surface).. . To match data scanned on an Axon scanner, use the RefNumber column contained in the Agilent-provided GAL file as the ID_REF column in sample submissions.. . *** A different version of this platform with the Agilent Probe names in the ID column is assigned accession number GPL7042."
