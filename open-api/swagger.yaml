    # OAuth2

    All tranSMART REST API calls need an Authorization header with a valid authentication token:


    ```
    Authorization: Bearer {token}
    ```


    # Monitoring

    For the application availability monitoring there is a
    [Spring Boot Actuator health endpoint](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html) configured.


    The `GET` `/health` call can be used to access this resource.

    The response contains application health information: a simple overall status (`UP` or `DOWN`) when accessed over
    an unauthenticated connection or full message details (including database status) when authenticated
    and the user has administrator role.


    For more details see [the official Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-health).


    # Constraints

    Constraints are used to build queries and are required in the `v2` API. They
    consist of a `Type` and that type's specific arguments. The implementation
    is in
    [Constraint.groovy](../transmart-core-db/src/main/groovy/org/transmartproject/db/multidimquery/query/Constraint.groovy).


    ## Combinations (And/Or)

    Most often a combination of constraints is needed to get the right result.
    This can be done by the constraints with type "and" and "or".

    They take a list `args` with constraints. All args will be evaluated
    together on each observation. So an 'and' operator with a `patient_set` and
    a `concept` will return all observations for the given concept linked to the
    patient set.

    However an `and` constraint with two ConceptConstraints will evaluate to an
    empty result, as no observation can have two concepts. This is also true
    even if nested with a different combination because constraints do not know
    scope.

    (There is also a constraint with type "combination" on which the And and Or
    constraints are built. It does not provide any functionality not provided by
    And and Or constraints, and it should be considered deprecated for direct
    usage.)


    Example:

    ```json

    {"type": "and",
     "args": [
        {"type": "patient_set", "patientIds": -62},
        {"type": "concept", "path":" \\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Heart Rate\\"}
        ]
    }

    ```


    ```json

    {"type": "or",
     "args": [
        {"type": "concept", "path":" \\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Blood Pressure\\"}
        {"type": "concept", "path":" \\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Heart Rate\\"}
        ]
    }

    ```


    ## StudyName

    Evaluate if an observation is part of a particular study


    Example:

    ```json

    {
      "type": "study_name",
      "studyId": "EHR"
    }

    ```


    ## Concept

    Evaluate if an observation is of a particular Concept. Either by `path` or
    `conceptCode`.


    ```json

    {
      "type": "concept",
      "path": "\\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Heart Rate\\",
      "conceptCode": "HR"
    }

    ```


    ## Value

    Evaluate if the value of an observation is within the given parameters. It
    needs a `valueType`, `operator` and `value`.

      `valueType`: ["NUMERIC", "STRING"]

      `operator`: [&lt;, &gt;, =, !=, &lt;=, &gt;=, in, like, contains, &lt;--&gt;].

      `operator` "contains" can be used only, when `valueType` equals "STRING".

      `value` can be a collection of "NUMERIC" or "STRING" only when "in" `operator` is used or `valueType` equals "NUMERIC" and between(&lt;--&gt;) `operator` is used (it must hold two values then).

    Example:

    ```json

    {
      "type": "value",
      "valueType": "NUMERIC",
      "operator": "=", "value": 176
    }

    ```


    ## Field

    Evaluate if a specific field of an observation is within the given
    parameters. it needs a `field`, `operator` and `value`.

      `operator`: [&lt;, &gt;, =, !=, &lt;=, &gt;=, in, like, contains, &lt;-, -&gt;, &lt;--&gt;].

      `operator` "contains" can be used only, when `field.type` equals "STRING".
      `operator` "&lt;-", "-&gt;" or "&lt;--&gt;" can be used only when `field.type` equals "DATE".

      `value` can be a collection only when "in" `operator` is used or `field.type` equals ["DATE", "NUMERIC"] and between(&lt;--&gt;) `operator` is used (it must hold two values then).

    Example:

    ```json

    {
      "type": "field",
      "field": {
          "dimension": "patient",
          "fieldName": "age",
          "type": "NUMERIC"
          },
      "operator": "!=",
      "value": 100
    }

    ```


    ## Time

    Evaluate if an observation is within the specified time period. It needs a
    `field` the type of which needs to be `DATE`. It needs a time relevant
    `operator` and a list of `values`.

    The list must hold one date for the before(&lt;-), after(-&gt;),
    lower_or_equal(&lt;=) and grater_or_equal(&gt;=) operators. It must hold two
    dates for the between(&lt;--&gt;) operator. If the given date field for an
    observation is empty, the observation will be ignored.


    `operator`: ["&lt;-", "-&gt;", "&lt;=", "&gt;=", "&lt;--&gt;"]


    Example:

    ```json

    {
      "type": "time",
      "field": {
          "dimension": "start time",
          "fieldName": "startDate",
          "type": "DATE"
          },
      "operator": "->",
      "values": ["2016-01-01T00:00:00Z"]
    }

    ```


    ## PatientSet

    Evaluate if an observation is liked to a patient in the set. You have to
    provide one of three: a `patientSetId`, a list of `patientIds` or a list of
    `subjectIds`.


    Examples:

    By specifying a patient set id.

    ```json

    {
        "type": "patient_set",
        "patientSetId": 28820
    }

    ```

    By specifying a list of patient identifiers.

    ```json

    {
        "type": "patient_set",
        "patientIds": [-62, -63]
    }

    ```

    And by specifying a list of subject identifiers (aka external identifiers).

    ```json

    {
        "type": "patient_set",
        "subjectIds": ["4543AB", "4543AC"]
    }

    ```


    ## SubSelection

    Create a subselection of patients, visits, or another dimension element (including modifier-based), and
    then select all observations for these dimension elements.


    Example: Select all observations for patients who have a certain diagnosis.

    ```json

    {
        "type": "subselection",
        "dimension": "patient",
        "constraint": {
            "type": "and",
            "args": [{
                    "type": "concept",
                    "path": "\\Public Studies\\EHR\\Diagnosis\\",
                    "conceptCode": "DIAG"
                }, {
                    "type": "value",
                    "valueType": "STRING",
                    "operator": "=",
                    "value": "My eye hurts"
                }]
        }
    }

    ```

    Example that includes modifier-based dimensions: Select all observations for patients who have certain tumor type and it's biomaterial with certain type.

    ```json

    {
        "type": "subselection",
        "dimension": "patient",
        "constraint": {
            "type": "and",
            "args": [{
                    "type": "concept",
                    "path": "\\Public Studies\\CSR\\02. Diagnosis information\\02. Tumor type\\"
                }, {
                    "type": "value",
                    "valueType": "STRING",
                    "operator": "=",
                    "value": "neuroblastoma"
                }, {
                    "type": "subselection",
                    "dimension": "Diagnosis ID",
                    "constraint": {
                        "type": "and",
                        "args": [{
                                "type": "concept",
                                "path": "\\Public Studies\\CSR\\04. Biomaterial information\\03. Biomaterial type\\"
                            }, {
                                "type": "value",
                                "valueType": "STRING",
                                "operator": "=",
                                "value": "RNA"
                            }]
                    }

                }]
        }
    }

    ```


    ## Temporal

    Evaluate if an observation happened before or after an event. It needs an
    `operator` and an `event`. Any constraint can be used as an event. Most
    likely a combination.

    `operator`: ["&lt;-", "-&gt;", "exists"]


    Example:

    ```json

    {
        "type": "temporal",
        "operator": "exists",
        "event": {
              "type": "value",
              "valueType": "NUMERIC",
              "operator": "=",
              "value": 60
              }
    }

    ```


    ## Null

    Evaluate if an specific field of an observation is null. It needs a field.


    Example:

    ```json

    {
        "type": "null",
        "field":{
            "dimension": "end time",
            "fieldName": "endDate",
            "type": "DATE"
            }
    }

    ```


    ## Modifier

    Evaluate if an observation is linked to the specified modifier. Optionally
    if that modifier has the specific value. It must have a `path`,
    `dimensionName` or `modifierCode` and may have `values` in the form of a
    ValueConstraint.


    Example:

    ```json

    {
        "type": "modifier",
        "modifierCode": "TNS:SMPL",
        "path": "\\Public Studies\\TUMOR_NORMAL_SAMPLES\\Sample Type\\",
        "dimensionName": "sample_type",
        "values": {
            "type": "value",
            "valueType": "STRING",
            "operator": "=",
            "value": "Tumor"
            }
    }

    ```


    ## Negation

    Evaluate if for an observation the given `arg` is false. `arg` is a
    constraint.


    Example:

    ```json

    {
        "type": "negation",
        "arg": {
            "type": "patient_set",
            "patientIds": [-62,-52,-42]
            }
    }

    ```

    returns all observations not linked to patient with id -62, -52 or -42


    ## Biomarker

    Used to filter high dimensional observations. It needs a 'biomarkerType' and
    a 'params' object. It can only be used

    when retrieving high dimensional data, and if so needs to be specified in a
    separate url parameter

    `biomarker_constraint`.

    `biomarkerType`: `["transcripts", "genes"]`.


    Example:

    ```json

    {
        "type": "biomarker",
        "biomarkerType": "genes",
        "params": {
            "names": ["TP53"]
            }
    }

    ```


    ## True

    **!!WARNING!!** Use mainly for testing.

    The most basic of constraints. Evaluates to true for all observations. This
    returns all observations the requesting user has access to.


    Example:

    ```json

    {
        "type": "true"
    }

    ```


    ## Relation

    Pedigree relations constraints.

    `relationTypeLabel` is mandatory and specifies code of relation. e.g. PAR
    (Parent-Child)

    `relatedSubjectsConstraint` is optional and specifies a constraint to apply
    to the related subjects.

    `biological` is optional field to restrict whether relation biological or
    not. If not specified, no filtering on this flag applied.

    `shareHousehold` is optional field to restrict whether subjects share the
    same address or not. If not specified, no filtering on this flag applied.


    Below is example of selecting subjects that are parents
    (`relationTypeLabel=PAR`) of subjects with ids `-62`, `-52` and `-42`.

    ```json

    {
        "type": "relation",
        "relatedSubjectsConstraint": {
           "type": "patient_set",
           "patientIds": [-62,-52,-42]
        }
        "relationTypeLabel": "PAR",
        "biological": true,
        "shareHousehold": true
    }

    ```


    # Response types

    #### application/json

    All calls support json. however this might not always be the best option.
    You will find schemas for the responses in this documentation.


    #### `application/hal+json`

    Only the tree_node endpoint supports the application/hal+json format.


    #### `application/x-protobuf`

    Calls that return observations support protobuf as a more efficient binary
    format. The description of the protobuf object can be found in
    [observations.proto](../transmart-rest-api/src/protobuf/v2/observations.proto).
    Information on [google
    protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

paths:
  /versions:
    get:
      description: >
        Gets all available API versions and prefixes. The API version is
        separate from the version of transmart itself.


        The API version follows semantic versioning: major versions can be
        incompatible, but minor version upgrades should be compatible with
        previous versions within the same major version. Patch versions are not
        used at the moment. The rest api can support multiple major versions at
        the same time using different prefixes.


        The default settings expose this endpoint without any authentication
        requirements, as the version info may be needed to select an
        authentication method, however clients should be prepared to only be
        able to see the supported major versions without authentication. In that
        case the innermost dictionary in the response json will only contain
        "id", "prefix" and "major" keys.


        Development and preview releases may also contain version tags, e.g. the
        version leading up to the development of 2.1 can be called 2.1-dev. Such
        tagged releases also support separate feature revisions. See
        `transmart-rest-api/grails-app/controllers/org/transmartproject/rest/VersionController.groovy`
        for details about that.

            json string that specifies the sort order of the observations.
            Sorting can be done on multiple dimensions. `["patient"]` sorts the
            observations on the patient dimension, `["patient", "concept"]`
            sorts the observations first on the patient, and then on concept.
            The sort order is on the 'key' field of the chosen dimension,
            sorting on arbitrary fields is not yet supported. For patients, this
            is the `id`, for concepts the `conceptCode`.

            It is also possible to specify the sort order to be ascending or
            descending. Use `[['patient', 'asc'], ['concept', 'desc']]` for that
            to sort the observations on patients first, ascending, and then on
            concepts descending.

            When requesting modifier dimensions, the supported sortings is very
            limited due to implementation constraints. Sorting support is
            limited to those dimensions that make up the primary key columns in
            the `i2b2demodata.observation_fact` table, and a few other supported
            dimensions. If you request a sort order that is not supported you
            will receive an HTTP 400 Bad Request error code.
