    # Constraints
    Constraints are used to build queries and are required in the `v2` API. They consist of a `Type` and that type's specific arguments. The implementation is in [Constraint.groovy](../transmart-core-db/src/main/groovy/org/transmartproject/db/multidimquery/query/Constraint.groovy).

    ## Combinations (And/Or)
    Most often a combination of constraints is needed to get the right result. This can be done by the constraints with type "and" and "or".
    They take a list `args` with constraints. All args will be evaluated together on each observation. So an 'and' operator with a `patient_set` and a `concept` will return all observations for the given concept linked to the patient set.
    However an `and` constraint with two ConceptConstraints will evaluate to an empty result, as no observation can have two concepts. This is also true even if nested with a different combination because constraints do not know scope.
    (There is also a constraint with type "combination" on which the And and Or constraints are built. It does not provide any functionality not provided by And and Or constraints, and it should be considered deprecated for direct usage.)
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {"type": "and",
     "args": [
        {"type": "patient_set", "patientIds": -62},
        {"type": "concept", "path":" \\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Heart Rate\\"}
        ]
    }
    ```

    ```json
    {"type": "or",
     "args": [
        {"type": "concept", "path":" \\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Blood Pressure\\"}
        {"type": "concept", "path":" \\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Heart Rate\\"}
        ]
    }
    ```

    ## StudyName
    Evaluate if an observation is part of a particular study
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "study_name",
      "studyId": "EHR"
    }
    ```
    
    ## Concept
    Evaluate if an observation is of a particular Concept. Either by `path` or `conceptCode`.
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "concept",
      "path": "\\Public Studies\\EHR\\Vital Signs\\Heart Rate\\",
      "conceptCode": "HR"
    }
    ```
    
    ## Value
    Evaluate if the value of an observation is within the given parameters. It needs a `valueType`, `operator` and `value`.
      `valueType`: [\"NUMERIC\", \"STRING\"]
      `operator`: [&lt;, &gt;, =, !=, &lt;=, &gt;=, in, like, contains]
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "value",
      "valueType": "NUMERIC",
      "operator": "=", "value": 176
    }
    ```
    
    ## Field
    Evaluate if a specific field of an observation is within the given parameters. it needs a `field`, `operator` and `value`.
      `operator`: [&lt;, &gt;, =, !=, &lt;=, &gt;=, in, like, contains]
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "field",
      "field": {
          "dimension": "patient",
          "fieldName": "age",
          "type": "NUMERIC"
          },
      "operator": "!=",
      "value": 100
    }
    ```
    
    ## Time
    Evaluate if an observation is within the specified time period. It needs a `field` the type of which needs to be `DATE`. It needs a time relevant `operator` and a list of `values`.
    The list must hold one date for the before(<-) and after(->) operator. It must hold two dates for the between(<-->) operator. If the given date field for an observation is empty, the observation will be ignored.
    `operator`: ["&lt;-", "-&gt;", "&lt;--&gt;"]
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "time",
      "field": {
          "dimension": "start time",
          "fieldName": "startDate",
          "type": "DATE"
          },
      "operator": "->",
      "values": ["2016-01-01T00:00:00Z"]
    }
    ```
    
    ## PatientSet
    Evaluate if an observation is liked to a patient in the set. It needs either a `patientSetId` or a list of `patientIds`.
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "patient_set",
        "patientSetId": 28820,
        "patientIds": [-62, -63]
    }
    ```

    ## SubSelection
    Create a subselection of patients, visits, or another dimension element, and then select all observations for these dimension elements.

    Example: Select all observations for patients who have a certain diagnosis.
    ```json
    {
        "type": "subselection",
        "dimension": "patient",
        "constraint": {
            "type": "and",
            "args": [{
                    "type": "concept",
                    "path": "\\Public Studies\\EHR\\Diagnosis\\",
                    "conceptCode": "DIAG"
                }, {
                    "type": "value",
                    "valueType": "STRING",
                    "operator": "=",
                    "value": "My eye hurts"
                }]
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Temporal
    Evaluate if an observation happened before or after an event. It needs an `operator` and an `event`. Any constraint can be used as an event. Most likely a combination.
    `operator`: ["&lt;-", "-&gt;", "exists"]
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "temporal",
        "operator": "exists",
        "event": {
              "type": "value",
              "valueType": "NUMERIC",
              "operator": "=",
              "value": 60
              }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Null
    Evaluate if an specific field of an observation is null. It needs a field.
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "null",
        "field":{
            "dimension": "end time",
            "fieldName": "endDate",
            "type": "DATE"
            }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Modifier
    Evaluate if an observation is linked to the specified modifier. Optionally if that modifier has the specific value. It must have a `path`, `dimensionName` or `modifierCode` and may have `values` in the form of a ValueConstraint.

    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "modifier",
        "modifierCode": "TNS:SMPL",
        "path": "\\Public Studies\\TUMOR_NORMAL_SAMPLES\\Sample Type\\",
        "dimensionName": "sample_type",
        "values": {
            "type": "value",
            "valueType": "STRING",
            "operator": "=",
            "value": "Tumor"
            }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Negation
    Evaluate if for an observation the given `arg` is false. `arg` is a constraint.
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "negation",
        "arg": {
            "type": "patient_set",
            "patientIds": [-62,-52,-42]
            }
    }
    ```
    returns all observations not linked to patient with id -62, -52 or -42
    
    ## Biomarker
    Used to filter high dimensional observations. It needs a 'biomarkerType' and a 'params' object. It can only be used
    when retrieving high dimensional data, and if so needs to be specified in a separate url parameter
    `biomarker_constraint`.
    `biomarkerType`: `["transcripts", "genes"]`.
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "biomarker",
        "biomarkerType": "genes",
        "params": {
            "names": ["TP53"]
            }
    }
    ```
    
    ## True
    **!!WARNING!!** Use mainly for testing.  
    The most basic of constraints. Evaluates to true for all observations. This returns all observations the requesting user has access to.
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "true"
    }
    ```
    
    
    # Response types
    #### application/json
    All calls support json. however this might not always be the best option. You will find schemas for the responses in this documentation.
    
    #### `application/hal+json`
    Only the tree_node endpoint supports the application/hal+json format.
    
    #### `application/x-protobuf`
    Calls that return observations support protobuf as a more efficient binary format. The description of the protobuf object can be found in [observations.proto](../transmart-rest-api/src/protobuf/v2/observations.proto). Information on [google protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

    get:
      description: |
        Gets all available API versions and prefixes. The API version is separate from the version of transmart itself.

        The API version follows semantic versioning: major versions can be incompatible, but minor version upgrades should be compatible with previous versions within the same major version. Patch versions are not used at the moment. The rest api can support multiple major versions at the same time using different prefixes.

        The default settings expose this endpoint without any authentication requirements, as the version info may be needed to select an authentication method, however clients should be prepared to only be able to see the supported major versions without authentication. In that case the innermost dictionary in the response json will only contain "id", "prefix" and "major" keys.

        Development and preview releases may also contain version tags, e.g. the version leading up to the development of 2.1 can be called 2.1-dev. Such tagged releases also support separate feature revisions. See `transmart-rest-api/grails-app/controllers/org/transmartproject/rest/VersionController.groovy` for details about that.
